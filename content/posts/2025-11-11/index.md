We’re excited to announce a new partnership between ​**DGrid**​, the decentralized AI inference network for Web3, and ​**Tagger**​, the leading decentralized AI data labeling, processing, management, and trading platform.

This collaboration brings a new layer of **data authentication and interoperability** to DGrid’s growing decentralized AI ecosystem.

## Partnership Overview

DGrid will integrate **Tagger’s data authentication protocol** to process collaborative data work between partners and clients within the DGrid network.

By leveraging Tagger’s blockchain-powered verification system, DGrid can enable **trustless data workflows** across multiple AI partners — ensuring every dataset used in inference and model training is transparent, authenticated, and verifiable.

This collaboration eliminates the traditional barriers of multi-platform coordination, **reducing operational costs** while enhancing the **credibility of shared data** across Web3 AI systems.

## Looking Ahead

As the decentralized AI stack continues to evolve, the DGrid × Tagger partnership represents a meaningful step toward building **an open, trusted, and efficient AI infrastructure** for Web3.

Together, we’re closing the gap between ​**data integrity and decentralized computation**​, paving the way for a truly transparent AI future.
