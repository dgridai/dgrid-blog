Bitcoin is entering a new phase. As Lightning, Ordinals, BRC tokens, Runes, and emerging rollups reshape what can be built on BTC, one challenge remains constant: ​*liquidity*​. Lava is addressing this head-on with Proof of Liquidity — a unifying layer that connects fragmented Bitcoin ecosystems and enables capital to finally flow freely.

At DGrid, we view this as the ideal opportunity for decentralized AI to take the lead.

## A Shared Vision: Open Liquidity, Open Intelligence

Both DGrid and Lava believe the next wave of Bitcoin innovation must be open, verifiable, and community-driven.

-Lava brings liquidity to Bitcoin Layer 2.

-DGrid brings a trustless AI layer that can reason, validate, optimize, and automate across the entire ecosystem.

Together, we’re building an environment where applications — from AMMs to cross-chain bridges, marketplaces, wallets, and future rollups — gain access to **verifiable AI agents** that enhance security, efficiency, and user experience without relying on centralized AI providers.

## What DGrid Enables for Lava

Through DGrid’s cryptographically verifiable AI infrastructure, developers on Lava can:

**● Run decentralized AI agents** for routing liquidity, pricing assets, or managing cross-chain flows.

**● Verify AI behavior on-chain** to ensure transparency and prevent model manipulation.

**​● Access a marketplace of community-provided LLMs**​, enabling low-cost, composable, and high-performance AI for Bitcoin apps.

This creates a sustainable loop: model providers earn directly from demand, while BTC Layer2 applications gain reliable intelligence to scale faster.

## Building the Future of Bitcoin Layer2

Lava is unlocking liquidity, DGrid is unlocking intelligence.

Both governed by the same principle: permissionless, decentralized, and aligned with the values that made Bitcoin possible.The next era of Bitcoin will be powered by liquidity and intelligence — and together, we’re making that future real.

**About DGrid**

DGrid is rebuilding AI infrastructure from the ground up — as a decentralized, modular, and verifiable AI inference network, making intelligent computation truly open, transparent, and accessible to all.
