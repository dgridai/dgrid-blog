We are pleased to announce a new strategic collaboration with ​**Conflux Network**​, one of the world’s most advanced and regulatory-compliant Layer 1 blockchains. As the only public blockchain endorsed for large-scale deployments in Asia — and a trusted partner of Shanghai, China Telecom, Little Red Book, McDonald’s China, and Oreo — Conflux brings unparalleled regional access, scalability, and institutional alignment.

For DGrid, this partnership represents a major milestone in bringing **verifiable decentralized AI** to global markets through a blockchain ecosystem designed for real adoption.

## Enabling AI-Native Web3 Experiences

By DGrid, applications on Conflux can now access decentralized, verifiable AI services — unlocking smarter interactions across DeFi, gaming, social, and enterprise use cases.
DGrid ensures that AI outputs remain transparent and tamper-resistant, giving developers the tools to build dynamic, personalized on-chain experiences without relying on centralized APIs.

For a network already supporting consumer-facing applications at scale, this brings a new dimension of intelligence and trust to Conflux’s ecosystem.

## Advancing the Future of Intelligent Web3 Infrastructure

This collaboration reflects a shared vision to push Web3 beyond basic transactions and into intelligent, verifiable interactions.
Conflux brings the scalability and institutional alignment needed for mass adoption, while DGrid delivers the AI compute layer that enables advanced logic and on-chain decisioning.

Our joint effort will support deeper ecosystem development and pave the way for applications where decentralized AI becomes a native, seamless part of the user experience.

## Looking Ahead

DGrid and Conflux are aligned on a simple belief: the future of Web3 will be smarter, more transparent, and increasingly AI-driven.
By combining Conflux’s high-performance Layer 1 with DGrid’s decentralized intelligence layer, we are creating a foundation for the next generation of blockchain applications — across Asia and worldwide.

The journey toward intelligent, decentralized infrastructure is accelerating, and together, we’re helping to shape what comes next. 🚀
