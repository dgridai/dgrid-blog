## A New Layer of Trust for AI on BNB Chain

We’re excited to announce our collaboration with BAS, the identity and reputation backbone of the BNB Chain ecosystem. BAS is setting the standard for verifiable identity through BNB Passport, real-world attestations, and a unified trust framework that connects users across Web3 and we’re honored to support that vision.

## How the Collaboration Works

DGrid will integrate BAS’s identity and attestation capabilities directly into our decentralized AI inference network.
This results in AI that can operate with verified users, authenticated assets, and credible reputation signals — all while remaining transparent, trustless, and community-powered.

By aligning BAS’s trusted identity with DGrid’s verifiable computation, developers can build AI interactions that are safer, more contextual, and more suitable for real-world use.

## What This Unlocks for the Ecosystem

By bringing BAS into DGrid’s inference network, the ecosystem gains new capabilities that weren’t possible before:

* Identity-aware AI:
  AI can respond based on verified users, authenticated assets, and real reputation.
* Permissioned or compliance-ready AI flows:
  DApps can enforce access logic, KYC layers, or risk filters without centralization.
* Safer and more contextual AI agents:
  Agents can rely on attestations instead of assumptions, enabling automation with integrity.
* Higher trust for RWA, SocialFi, and institutional-grade use cases:
  Real-world verification meets transparent, on-chain AI computation.

This collaboration creates a new category of infrastructure: trusted identity × trustless AI, working together natively on BNB Chain.

## Looking Forward

BAS is shaping the trust architecture that will support the next billion users entering Web3. DGrid will focus on bringing open, verifiable AI to that foundation — enhancing BAS’s vision with decentralized intelligence that is transparent, auditable, and community-driven.

This is just the beginning.
We’re committed to building alongside BAS and helping the BNB Chain ecosystem evolve toward a future where identity, reputation, and AI work in harmony — securely, openly, and at scale.

## About DGrid

DGrid is rebuilding AI infrastructure from the ground up — as a decentralized, modular, and verifiable AI inference network, making intelligent computation truly open, transparent, and accessible to all.

## About BAS

BAS is BNB Chain’s answer to EAS, but broader in scope: connecting centralized KYC, real-world credentials, and multi-chain use cases. Web2 reputation on-chain is the next billion-user unlock. BAS is the bridge.
