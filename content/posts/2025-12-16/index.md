We’re collaborating with LinkLayerAI, an incentive protocol built around trading data and social intelligence.

This collaboration starts from a simple belief: as AI agents become native actors in Web3 markets, how intelligence is executed matters as much as the intelligence itself.

LinkLayerAI is building systems where trading behavior, social signals, and incentives converge. Agents don’t just observe markets — they participate in them, shape narratives, and influence outcomes. In environments like this, execution cannot remain opaque, centralized, or taken for granted.

## Execution Is the New Trust Boundary

LinkLayerAI is building agent-driven systems where trading behavior, social signals, and incentives converge. These agents actively influence markets, not just observe them.

DGrid supports this ecosystem at the AI inference layer, providing decentralized and verifiable execution for agent workloads. Intelligence no longer needs to rely on opaque backends, and can instead be produced on open, credibly neutral infrastructure.

LinkLayerAI leads at the protocol and agent layer, DGrid operates quietly underneath.

## What This Enables

With decentralized inference, agent execution becomes more transparent and auditable. Incentives can align not only around outcomes, but around how intelligence itself is generated.

This creates a stronger foundation for agent-native markets — markets that remain open, resilient, and permissionless as they scale.

## The Road Ahead

This collaboration reflects a shared view of where Web3 is heading: toward markets where agents act continuously, incentives are explicit, and infrastructure stays neutral.

LinkLayerAI is building how intelligence is coordinated.
DGrid is focused on how intelligence is executed.

As agents become first-class market participants, execution should no longer be a black box.

That’s the direction we’re aligned on.
