We’re excited to collaborate with Unibase, a leading decentralized AI memory layer powering autonomous agents with long-term memory and cross-platform interoperability.

As AI agents evolve from stateless tools into persistent, self-improving entities, memory becomes a first-class primitive. Unibase is at the forefront of this shift — building the infrastructure that allows agents to remember, coordinate, and evolve across ecosystems without centralized control.

This collaboration reflects a shared direction, but a clear division of focus.

## Memory Comes First

Unibase is defining how agents store memory, access real-time data, and interoperate across protocols. With modules like Membase, AIP Protocol, and Unibase DA, it establishes the foundation for agents that don’t reset, fragment, or depend on siloed platforms.

As memory becomes persistent and sovereign, the way agents execute their intelligence becomes equally important.

## DGrid’s Role in the Stack

DGrid supports Unibase by providing decentralized, verifiable AI inference for agent execution.

Rather than positioning inference as a centralized service or opaque backend, DGrid enables agents to run computation on open networks — where execution can be traced, verified, and aligned with on-chain incentives.

Unibase defines how agents remember and evolve.
DGrid helps ensure how agents think and act remains open, transparent, and trust-minimized.

This is not about replacing existing systems overnight, but about giving Unibase’s growing agent ecosystem a credible, decentralized execution layer as it scales.

## What This Unlocks

Together, Unibase and DGrid move closer to a full-stack, Web3-native agent architecture:

Agents can:

* Persist long-term memory on decentralized infrastructure
* Run inference without relying on centralized AI providers
* Verify actions and intelligence end-to-end
* Coordinate across protocols without hidden trust assumptions

This combination enables agents that are not only autonomous in name, but autonomous by design.

## Looking Forward

This collaboration is a long-term alignment around where AI in Web3 is heading.

Unibase is building the memory and interoperability layer for agent-native systems.
DGrid is focused on ensuring that intelligent execution runs on infrastructure Web3 can trust.

As AI agents become more persistent, more capable, and more embedded in markets and applications, the foundations they rely on matter.

We’re proud to support Unibase as it continues to define the future of decentralized, sovereign AI agents.
