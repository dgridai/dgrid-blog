DGrid is partnering with TradeTalent to support AI-driven skill verification and talent matching in real hiring workflows.

As enterprises increasingly rely on AI to screen candidates and match roles, two requirements become unavoidable: results need to be reliable, and the process needs to be explainable. This collaboration focuses on addressing both.

## Where the Integration Matters

TradeTalent is building a decentralized talent network that enables on-chain skill attestation, anonymous matching, and token-based incentives using DID and ZK technology. These components are already being applied to real hiring and community engagement scenarios.

DGrid complements this by providing a decentralized AI inference layer that supports how AI models are executed within these flows. Instead of relying on a single centralized provider, AI workloads can be run in a more transparent and predictable environment, aligned with on-chain verification.

This allows TradeTalent to apply AI in hiring pipelines without introducing new trust bottlenecks at the execution layer.

## Enterprise-Focused Benefits

For enterprise users, this collaboration translates into concrete improvements:

* ​**More reliable AI-assisted screening**​, with consistent inference behavior
* **Better alignment between AI decisions and on-chain credentials**
* ​**Stronger privacy guarantees**​, supported by DID and ZK-based attestations
* **Reduced dependence on centralized AI infrastructure**

These benefits matter when AI is part of decision-making that impacts real people and organizations.

## What’s Ahead

This partnership is designed to scale with usage.

As TradeTalent continues to expand enterprise adoption and as DGrid improves inference efficiency and cost control, both teams are aligned on supporting production-grade hiring workflows — not just experimental features.

The goal is straightforward: make AI-assisted hiring usable, trustworthy, and compatible with decentralized systems.

That’s what we’re building toward together.
