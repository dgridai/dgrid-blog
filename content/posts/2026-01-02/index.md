The convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Web3 is no longer a theoretical narrative — it is a live, rapidly expanding economy. As we enter 2026, the window to move from passive observer to foundational stakeholder is opening.

On January 1, 2026, at 00:00 UTC, the DGrid Genesis Premium(Genesis Pass + Premium subscription) officially goes live. This is more than a subscription or an NFT; it is your Genesis Dividend Position — a rare, early-access stake in one of the most robust decentralized AI inference networks in the world.

For Web3 investors, AI builders, model providers, and node operators, this is the definitive moment to lock in asymmetric exposure to the DGrid ecosystem.

## Why Genesis, Why Now?

The DGrid Genesis Premium is designed for those who understand that the long-term value of AI lies in decentralization, open participation, and aligned incentives.

By becoming a Genesis member, you are not simply “buying access”; you are:

• Securing a permanent role in the emerging decentralized AI economy

• Gaining early economic rights to \$DGAI and ecosystem upside

• Accessing deep AI model and API utility from day one

• Participating in the governance and growth of the DGrid network

We have structured Genesis benefits to combine:

• Immediate utility (credits, model/API usage, discounts, access)

• Ongoing yield and upside (ecosystem rewards, future airdrops, governance)

• Long-term network participation (node, infra, and provider roles)

## Core Genesis Membership Benefits

1. **Genesis Contributor Rewards**

*Continuous Ecosystem Alignment via \$DGAI*

As a Genesis member, you are recognized as an early architect of the DGrid network.

• Ongoing DGAI Ecosystem Rewards
Simply by holding and maintaining your Genesis status, you become eligible for continuous DGAI ecosystem contribution rewards, designed to reflect and reward your early support, network participation, and long-term alignment.

• Network Growth-Linked Upside
As more users, AI models, and computational tasks are onboarded, the total value and relevance of \$DGAI-based distributions are intended to scale alongside overall network activity.

Genesis status is not just access — it is a yield-bearing participation role in the infrastructure of decentralized AI.

2. **High-Limit Model & API Access**

*Institutional-Grade AI Usage Rights from Day One*

Genesis members receive powerful, utility-focused AI access tailored to both builders and power users.

• Monthly Usage Credits — 300USD Equivalent Receive
Receive 300 USD worth of platform credits every month, redeemable against any AI model, Agent, or workflow deployed on DGrid. Whether you are fine-tuning, running inference, or orchestrating agents, your credits cover direct usage costs.

• Daily Free Model Pool — 100 Calls / Day
Enjoy 100 free calls per day to a curated set of DGrid-native and partner-provided models. This “always-on” access is ideal for experimentation, prototyping, and routine workloads without incremental cost.

• Priority API & Model Access
Genesis members gain priority access to high-demand and limited-availability models, including:

￮ Newly onboarded foundation models

￮ Experimental, specialized, or partner-exclusive models

￮ Time-limited or quota-gated test deployments

When queues form and capacity is constrained, Genesis calls are routed through the fast lane.

• Enhanced Rate Limits & Stability
Higher per-minute and daily rate limits ensure your applications, automations, and agents can scale without hitting throttling thresholds as quickly as standard users.

3. **Product & Feature Early Access**

*Build the Future Product Surface of DGrid*

Genesis members are not passive users — they are design partners.

• Alpha / Beta Priority Access
Gain first access to new:

￮ Products and dApps on DGrid

￮ Core infrastructure features (e.g., routing, scheduling, privacy layers)

￮ Developer tools, SDKs, and dashboards

• Direct Feedback Loop with the Core Team
Participate in closed feedback cycles, UX sessions, and roadmap reviews. Your usage patterns and suggestions directly shape:

￮ Model integration priorities

￮ Platform economics and pricing

￮ Tooling and developer ergonomics

If you build or invest in AI, Genesis gives you front-row influence over DGrid’s direction.

4. **Ecosystem Co-Building Priority**

*From User to Provider, from Consumer to Infrastructure Partner*

Genesis membership unlocks preferential pathways to become a value-adding participant, not just an end-user.

• AI Provider Priority (LLM / Agent Provider Rights)
Genesis members gain priority review and onboarding when applying to:

￮ List their AI models on the DGrid marketplace

￮ Publish Agents, tools, or pipelines as monetizable services

• Network Infrastructure & Operations Partner Priority
Gain preferred access to roles in maintaining and scaling DGrid’s decentralized infrastructure, including:

￮ Node operation and computational provisioning

￮ Storage and bandwidth services

￮ Specialized infra roles as they are introduced

5. **Governance & Community Privileges**

*Shape the Policy, Economics, and Future Surface of DGrid*

As DGrid progressively decentralizes, Genesis members will be central to its governance and community.

• Enhanced DAO Governance Weight
In future community governance modules, Genesis votes carry higher weight compared to standard participants. This may apply to:

￮ Protocol parameter changes

￮ Treasury allocation decisions

￮ Model integration and deprecation proposals

￮ Incentive program design

• Private Genesis Community Channels
Join Genesis-only private groups featuring:

￮ Direct access to the founding team

￮ Dialogue with ecosystem investors and strategic partners

￮ Collaboration with other top-tier builders, researchers, and node operators
