The Web3 ecosystem thrives on community wisdom — and today, we’re putting that power front and center. To power this next chapter, DGrid AI is proud to officially live on [**Galxe Starboard**](https://app.galxe.com/quest/DGridAI/starboard/1225), unlocking a \$100,000 reward pool (featuring \$DGAI and \$USDT) to celebrate and reward the most visionary, insightful voices in our community.

This isn’t just a campaign. It’s a call to co-create a future where AI is *efficiently flowing, fairly distributed, and trustfully verifiable* — and your insights will help get us there.

## What Is DGrid?

DGrid unites Web3 and AI through four foundational pillars of open intelligence:

* **Decentralized Routing & Verification Network:** Powered by Proof of Quality (PoQ), every AI inference, execution step, and output is cryptographically traceable — replacing blind trust with verifiable evidence for Web3’s high-stakes use cases.
* **LLM & Agent Free Market:** An open marketplace where creators set their own terms, breaking platform monopolies to ensure model builders, prompt engineers, and Agent developers earn directly from global demand.
* **Unified API & Elastic Scheduling:** A single gateway to thousands of models and Agents, eliminating redundant development for builders — paired with a distributed node network that erases single points of failure and scales with ecosystem growth.
* **AI DAO:** Community governance at the core, aligning incentives for node operators, developers, and users to steer the network toward fairness, interoperability, and the open web’s best interests.

This is AI reimagined for Web3: efficient, fair, and trusted by design.

## Why It Matters

Today’s AI ecosystem is fragmented, centralized, and value-starved.Models are siloed behind closed interfaces, creators are denied their fair share, and inference results are untraceable — leaving Web3 and traditional sectors stuck in inefficiency and distrust.

DGrid changes that. We embed openness and accountability into the AI stack: breaking fragmentation with unified access, ending monopolies with a creator-centric market, and bridging trust gaps with verifiable execution.

> *This is not just a better AI network.It’s a new foundation for the open web — where AI serves everyone, not just a few.*

## Announcing the \$100K Galxe Starboard Insight Campaign

We’re launching a \$100,000 rewards campaign on Galxe Starboard — designed to surface the sharpest, most actionable insights about DGrid’s role in redefining AI for Web3.

This is no hype play. It’s a call for insights that move the needle: high-quality X (Twitter) threads and deep-dive analysis that unpack DGrid’s role in redefining AI.

* ​**Reward Pool**​: \$100K in \$DGAI + \$USDT
* ​**Platform**​: Galxe Starboard
* ​**Focus**​: Sharp, actionable takes that shape the future of decentralized AI

Every impactful insight pushes us closer to a web where AI is fair, efficient, and accountable — now’s your chance to lead, and earn.

## How the Campaign Works

The campaign uses **Galxe Aura Points** — a mechanism that scores contributions based on *merit (quality)* and ​*impact (engagement)*​. Here’s how to join:

## 1. Create High-Quality Content About DGrid

Publish high-signal X (Twitter) threads and long-form content that explore topics such as:

* What is DGrid and why a decentralized smart AI network matters
* How DGrid’s three-tier architecture solves Web3 AI’s fragmentation problem
* The role of the PoQ algorithm in building trusted inference environments
* How the LLM & Agent Free Market empowers creators (e.g., prompt engineers, model providers)
* Real-world use cases for DGrid (e.g., DeFi strategy generation, smart contract analysis, DAO decision support)

The more original, clear, and insightful your work, the more it stands out.

## 2. Share on X and Let the Community React

Post your threads and insights about DGrid on X (Twitter). Make sure to:

* Explicitly reference DGrid / @dgrid\_ai
* Aim for structured, multi-tweet threads that tell a story, explain a concept, or break down a thesis
* Encourage meaningful discussion rather than superficial engagement

## 3. Earn Aura Points & Claim Rewards

Your contributions will be evaluated using Aura points, combining:

* Content quality
* Engagement data

At the end of the campaign:

* Participants will be ranked based on their Aura scores
* The \$100,000 reward pool (\$DGAI + \$USDT) will be distributed among contributors according to these rankings
* Leading voices will gain early visibility in the DGrid ecosystem
* Also, don’t forget to participate in our [Galxe Quest campaign](https://app.galxe.com/quest/DGridAI/GCBXEtYyTa?refer=space_home).
