Today, DGrid is proud to announce that **\$300 in monthly AI usage credits** — a core benefit of the DGrid Genesis Premium Membership — has officially launched and been automatically credited to all active Genesis Pass holders’ accounts. This long-awaited perk, originally outlined as a cornerstone of Genesis membership, is now fully operational, empowering builders, power users, and AI innovators to access enterprise-grade AI tools by alleviating usage cost burdens through dedicated monthly resources.

## What You Need to Know About Your Monthly Usage Credits

For AI builders and power users, accessing premium AI capabilities typically comes with a prohibitive price tag — *if* you’re subscribing to individual tools. Let’s break down the cost of going all-in with leading AI services:

* OpenAI Pro: \$200/month
* Grok Heavy: \$300/month
* Gemini Ultra: \$250/month
* Claude Max: \$200/month

Individually, these flagship subscriptions add up to **\$950/month (\$11,400/year)** — a cost that puts enterprise-grade AI out of reach for most startups, researchers, and teams.

DGrid Genesis Premium flips this script: For a one-time investment of just \$1,580 (equivalent to \~\$131/month), you unlock the equivalent of \$300 in monthly AI usage credits — giving you access to a diverse ecosystem of models, agents, and workflows *without* the hassle of multiple subscriptions. This isn’t just cost savings — it’s getting the combined power of top-tier AI tools at a fraction of the price.

As a Genesis Premium member, your monthly credits are tailored to fuel every stage of your AI journey — from prototyping to production:

* ​**Equivalent Value in Platform Credits**​: Your monthly allocation of credits (valued at \$300) is now active, refreshing automatically every 30 days. Designed to align with real-world AI workload needs, the credits do not roll over — unutilized amounts reset with each monthly cycle, encouraging you to experiment, scale, and innovate freely without hoarding resources.
* ​**Universal Redemption**​: Use credits for any DGrid service: fine-tuning open-source or curated models (from Llama 3 to specialized industry models), running low-latency inference jobs, deploying AI Agents, or orchestrating multi-step workflows. No siloed tools — one credit pool for all your AI needs.
* ​**Built for Builders & Power Users Alike**​: Whether you’re a startup founder prototyping a new AI tool, a developer scaling a production workload, or a researcher testing cutting-edge models, these credits remove the financial constraints that slow innovation. No more choosing between “testing one more model” and “staying within budget.”

This benefit joins DGrid’s existing Genesis Premium perks — including exclusive low-latency execution configurations, ongoing \$DGAI ecosystem token distributions, exclusive \$IOTX airdrops from the IoTeX alliance, early access to new products, and priority eligibility to become a Model Provider or Node Operator.

## How Genesis Members Can Check Their Credits

1. ​**Log In to Your DGrid Account**​: Visit the DGrid Premium dashboard (https://dgrid.ai/credits).
2. ​**Locate the “Account” Tab**​: Find the dedicated section to view your current credit balance, transaction history, and payment history.
3. ​**Start Using Immediately**​: Credits are automatically applied to your next usage.
