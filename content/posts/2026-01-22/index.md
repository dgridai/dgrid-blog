Infrastructure should be invisible, reliable, and complete. Today, DGrid takes a major step towards that goal by partnering with OpenLedger.

At DGrid, our mission has always been to build the ultimate smart inference and **scheduling layer** for Web3. We provide the marketplace, the routing, and the compute. But an inference network is only as good as the data flowing through it.

That is why we are joining forces with OpenLedger.

### The Synergy

This collaboration bridges two critical layers of the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) stack:

* **DGrid :** We provide the elastic, decentralized network where models run. Our Proof of Quality (PoQ) algorithm ensures that when a task is scheduled, it is executed correctly and efficiently.
* **OpenLedger :** They provide the verifiable infrastructure that ensures data integrity before it ever reaches our models.

### Why We Are Better Together

For developers building on DGrid, this integration aims to solve the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” problem at the protocol level. By connecting our Model Marketplace with OpenLedger’s data consensus, we are empowering developers to build:

1. **Verifiable Agents:** Autonomous bots that make decisions based on proven data.
2. **Transparent Prediction Markets:** Models that run on DGrid using tamper-proof data feeds.
3. **High-Value LLMs:** Specialized models that command higher prices because their data lineage is clear and trusted.

### A Shared Vision for Decentralized AI

Both DGrid and OpenLedger share a DNA of transparency. DGrid’s community-driven governance and OpenLedger’s sovereign data approach are perfectly aligned.

Together, we are delivering the tooling developers need to leave centralized walled gardens behind.

### About DGrid

DGrid is rebuilding AI infrastructure from the ground up — as a decentralized, modular, and verifiable AI inference network, making intelligent computation truly open, transparent, and accessible to all.
