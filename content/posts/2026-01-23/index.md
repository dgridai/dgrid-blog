We live in the golden age of AI development. Accessing intelligence has never been easier. But building a truly great AI product? That is still hard.

As developers, we constantly face a painful trade-off: *“Do I use the smartest model and hurt my margins, or do I use a cheaper model and sacrifice user experience?”*

This calculation stifles innovation. It forces you to optimize for the invoice, rather than optimizing for the user.

**At DGrid, we want to change this equation.**

We believe that great products shouldn’t die because the unit economics haven’t stabilized yet. That is why we are launching the ​**DGrid Developer Grant Program**​.

## The Grant: Tailored Support for Every Stage

We are deploying a flexible fund with packages ranging from ​**\$50 to \$50,000**​. We don’t believe in a “one-size-fits-all” approach. Instead, we size the grant to match your project’s potential and needs.

**Our goal is to make a meaningful dent in your infrastructure costs:**

* **For Early Builders & MVP:** For many of you, this grant will effectively ​**eliminate your API bill entirely**​, giving you the runway to experiment, break things, and find Product-Market Fit without spending a dime.
* **For Scaling Products:** If you are already handling significant traffic, we know the costs can be brutal. We want to provide a **substantial subsidy** to offset your operational overhead, helping you improve your margins while you scale.

## Why DGrid?

We are building the ultimate unified infrastructure for LLM deployment. We aggregate the world’s best open and closed-source models into a single, standardized API.

But infrastructure needs a thriving ecosystem.

We are launching this grant because we act as a partner, not just a vendor. By absorbing a portion of the cost complexity, we empower you to build with the best tools available.

We are launching this grant because we believe that if we support you today — by lowering your barriers and improving your margins — you will build better products. And when you succeed, we succeed.

## How It Works

1. **Apply:** Fill the [form](https://forms.gle/4VqnTgN6RNpfGLJR6) (it takes 2 minutes).
2. **Allocation:** Our team reviews your project and contacts you. Then allocates a granted credit package in your DGrid account.
3. **Build:** You get unrestricted access to our model garden.

**Let’s Get Started.**

There are no strings attached. No equity to give up, just a shared goal: building better AI products with fewer constraints.

Use the grant to explore our unified API, stress-test your prompts, or fix your unit economics. The credits are yours to deploy however you see fit.

## About DGrid

DGrid is rebuilding AI infrastructure from the ground up — as a decentralized, modular, and verifiable AI inference network, making intelligent computation truly open, transparent, and accessible to all.
