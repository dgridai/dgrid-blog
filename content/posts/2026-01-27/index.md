The decentralized AI landscape is shifting from theoretical concepts to tangible infrastructure. Today, DGrid is proud to announce a strategic partnership with RAX Finance, the first full-stack RWA layer for AI infrastructure.
By uniting DGrid’s intelligent orchestration with RAX’s institutional-grade hardware, we are building a verifiable and liquid foundation for the global AI economy.

## Infrastructure Meets Intelligence

This collaboration marks the convergence of Physical Assets and Smart Execution.

RAX Finance serves as the “Physical Layer,” transforming GPU resources, data centers, and energy infrastructure into verifiable, yield-bearing on-chain assets. DGrid acts as the “Intelligence Layer,” providing a decentralized smart network that offers a unified marketplace and scheduling engine for trustless access to AI models and Agents. By merging these two layers, we are creating a unified pipeline where real-world compute is seamlessly integrated into the Web3 ecosystem.

## A Full-Stack AI Pipeline

The collaboration integrates RAX’s hardware directly into DGrid’s Decentralized Routing & Verification Network to streamline the transition from physical compute to AI execution.

* **Intelligent Dispatching:** DGrid’s engine intelligently routes inference requests to RAX’s tokenized GPU resources, ensuring maximum active utilization of on-chain hardware and preventing idle capacity.
* **Verification via PoQ:** To guarantee institutional-grade reliability, DGrid applies its Proof of Quality (PoQ) algorithm to all tasks executed on RAX’s infrastructure. This provides a trustless layer that ensures performance and accuracy are delivered exactly as promised.
* **Unified Marketplace:** RAX’s assets are integrated into DGrid’s LLM & Agent Free Market, allowing developers and model providers to host, price, and monetize AI services using stable, high-performance compute.

## Solving Critical AI Bottlenecks

This partnership directly addresses key industry hurdles. We solve resource fragmentation by unlocking institutional-grade GPUs previously inaccessible to decentralized developers. We close the trust gap through DGrid’s verification network, making inference on RAX’s hardware verifiable in real-time.

Finally, we reduce operational costs by removing intermediaries and utilizing smart scheduling to optimize real-world assets.

## The Future of Verifiable AI

We are moving toward a future where AI compute is a liquid, verifiable, and yield-bearing asset class. As DGrid expands, partnering with RAX Finance ensures our network is grounded in the strongest physical foundations available.

Together, we are co-building the essential stack for an autonomous AI economy where Real Infrastructure meets Smart Inference.
