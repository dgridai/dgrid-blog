As the DGrid team, we are excited to introduce **DGrid AI Arena** — a brand‑new feature that transforms the way you interact with AI and rewards you for every meaningful choice you make.

DGrid AI Arena is more than a gamified interface. It is the engine that powers how DGrid’s AI network learns, improves, and evolves, with the community’s judgment at its core. Every time you compare AI responses or invite new users, you are not only earning real rewards in USDT, but also directly shaping the future of the DGrid AI ecosystem.

## What Is DGrid AI Arena?

DGrid AI Arena is a dedicated hub inside DGrid where you can:

* **Battle AI models** in the *AI Battle* section by choosing the better answer between two anonymous AI responses.
* **Earn points** for your participation and referrals.
* **Convert points into real USDT rewards** and compete on a weekly leaderboard for ​**a shared prize pool**​.

Our goal is simple:

***Empower the community to help us evaluate, optimize, and deploy better AI models — and reward you fairly for the value you create.***

## AI Battle: Help Train DGrid AI, Earn Points Every Day

At the heart of AI Arena is the AI Battle section — a simple, engaging way for you to interact with real AI outputs and guide our model development.

### How AI Battle Works

**5 Daily Missions, Every Day**

* Once you enter AI Battle, you can complete up to 5 Daily Missions per day.
* Each mission is quick, intuitive, and designed to take only a short moment of your time.

**Compare Two Anonymous AI Answers**

* In each mission, you will see:
  - A random question or prompt, and
  - Two anonymous AI model responses.
* Read both answers carefully and decide which one better fits your expectations or needs.

**Make Your Choice, Earn Points**

* Select the answer you think is better.
* After enough users participate, the community consensus emerges. Your reward depends on how your choice aligns:
  - If your choice matches the majority of participants, you earn 20 points.
  - If your choice differs from the majority, you still earn 10 points.
* This means every pick is rewarded. There is no “wrong” participation — your input is always valuable.

**Your Votes Shape the DGrid AI Network**

* Behind the scenes, DGrid aggregates user decisions and feedback to:
  - Evaluate which models perform better.
  - Understand what users value in real-world AI answers.
  - Guide how we develop, improve, and release DGrid’s AI models.
* In other words, your daily choices in AI Battle directly influence the evolution of DGrid AI.

AI Battle is designed to be simple for you — but strategically powerful for DGrid. By making thousands of micro‑decisions together, the community helps us build a more reliable, human‑aligned AI LLM network.

## Points System: Earn By Playing and Inviting

Within DGrid AI Arena, points are the core metric of your activity and contribution. They are also the bridge between your actions and real USDT rewards.

### How to Earn Points

There are two main ways to earn points:

**Daily Missions in AI Battle**

* Each mission gives you 10–20 points, depending on whether your pick matches the community majority.
* You can complete up to 5 missions per day, allowing you to steadily accumulate points over time while contributing to DGrid AI’s training process.

**Referral Points by Inviting New Users**

* Share DGrid AI Arena with others and earn Referral Points.
* For each valid referred user, you receive 100 points.
* This lets you scale your rewards not just through your own participation, but also through the growth of the DGrid community you help bring in.

Your total points are then used in two ways:

* To redeem direct USDT rewards, and
* To determine your share of the weekly prize pool via the leaderboard.

## Rewards: Turn Your Points Into Real USDT

DGrid AI Arena is not just about virtual points. Your participation converts directly into real, on‑chain value.

### Direct Redemption: Points → USDT

You can redeem your accumulated points into USDT at a fixed rate:

* Conversion rate:
  - 1,000 Points = 1 USDT
* Minimum redemption amount:
  - 1,000 Points (i.e., at least 1 USDT equivalent)
* Once redeemed, your USDT is transferred directly to your wallet.

This gives you a clear, transparent relationship between your effort and your earnings:

More missions completed and more referrals → More points → More USDT in your wallet.

### Weekly Leaderboard: Compete for a Shared Prize Pool

In addition to direct redemption, DGrid AI Arena features a Weekly Leaderboard that rewards the most active and engaged participants.

* Every week, there is a USD 300 prize pool.
* Top players share this USD 300 based on their weekly points.
* Weekly Reward Distribution works proportionally:
  - The more points you earn during the week,
  - The larger your share of the USD 300 pool.

This dual‑reward mechanism ensures that:

* Casual users still earn value through point redemption.
* Power users and top contributors are additionally rewarded for their higher engagement and impact.
