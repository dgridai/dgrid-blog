The decentralized AI landscape is shifting from intelligence to financial execution. Today, DGrid is proud to announce a strategic partnership with zCloak Network, the foundational protocol for enterprise-grade on-chain finance.

By uniting DGrid’s intelligent orchestration with zCloak’s modular infrastructure, we are building a secure, verifiable, and programmable foundation for the global AI economy.

## Intelligence Meets Secure Governance

This collaboration marks the convergence of “Smart Execution” and “Cryptographic Assurance”.

zCloak Network serves as the "Financial Layer," providing modular infrastructure for secure treasury management and ZK-based verification. DGrid acts as the "Intelligence Layer," providing a decentralized smart network and scheduling engine for trustless access to AI models. By merging these layers, we enable AI agents to not only process data but also securely manage assets with enterprise-grade certainty.

## A Full-Stack AI Financial Pipeline

By integrating zCloak’s modular infrastructure directly into DGrid’s Verification Network, we are building a Full-Stack AI Financial Pipeline that streamlines the transition from AI inference to secure on-chain settlement.

This collaboration addresses critical industry bottlenecks through several key layers:

* Trustless Verification: Combining DGrid’s Proof of Quality (PoQ) with zCloak’s ZK-based Truth Layer ensures agent identities and data integrity are cryptographically verifiable.
* Financial Autonomy: Equipping AI agents with self-custodial treasuries and automated settlement capabilities solves financial fragmentation and reduces operational risk.
* Secure OS: Providing decentralized agents with a native, secure "wallet" and operating system allows them to thrive in a trustless global economy.

## The Future of Verifiable AI Finance

We are moving toward a future where AI Agents are economically empowered participants. Partnering with zCloak Network ensures DGrid is grounded in the most secure and modular financial foundations available.

Together, we are co-building the essential stack for an autonomous AI economy where Smart Inference meets Secure Finance.
