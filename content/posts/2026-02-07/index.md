The integration of AI and Web3 is entering a deep integration phase. On one side, AI models and agents are emerging in an endless stream, with diverse capabilities covering multiple scenarios; on the other, countless developers and application scenarios are eager to access high-quality AI solutions. Yet, the severe supply-demand mismatch stands as an invisible barrier — abundant models and Agents remain undiscovered and underutilized, while users struggle to quickly and cost-effectively locate and integrate the right AI tools to meet their needs.

DGrid AI emerges as a solution — a decentralized AI network built on BNB Chain, designed to break down these barriers and turn AI capabilities into public infrastructure for the open web.

## What is DGrid AI?

DGrid AI’s core mission is clear and unwavering:

> Build a trusted, efficient AI network that connects supply and demand, enabling AI to truly serve the open web.

Put simply, DGrid targets the core disconnect in the AI ecosystem:

* ​**Supply Side**​: Explosive growth in AI models, AI Agents, and computing power nodes.
* ​**Demand Side**​: Increasingly diverse AI needs from developers, application platforms, and end-users.
* ​**Core Disconnect**​: Centralized platforms monopolize value distribution, while fragmented interfaces drive up access costs. ​**High-quality models and agents are hard to discover or recommend, while users struggle to quickly find solutions tailored to their needs**​.

DGrid’s solution is to build decentralized infrastructure on BNB Chain, seamlessly connecting models, computing nodes, developers, and users. This turns AI capabilities into **routable liquidity** on the chain — freely routable, independently priced, and fully verifiable.

## DGrid’s Architecture & Positioning

To systematically address these pain points, DGrid has built a **three-tier architecture** on BNB Chain, achieving deep integration between the AI intelligence layer and Web3’s trust layer:

### 1. Decentralized Routing & Verification Network

Serving as the network’s “infrastructure gateway,” its core role is to eliminate interface fragmentation:

* Provides a unified API that encapsulates multi-model and multi-node capabilities into standardized services.
* Uses intelligent routing algorithms to route user requests to the most suitable models and nodes.
* Records key data on BNB Chain, enabling traceable inference processes and auditable results.

### 2. LLM & Agent Free Market

A **value-release platform** for AI creators, redefining value distribution logic:

* Model providers, Agent builders, and Prompt engineers can list their capabilities freely and reach global users directly.
* Supports custom pricing and revenue-sharing mechanisms, freeing creators from platform commissions and traffic control.
* All value flows are on-chain, ensuring transparent distribution.

### 3. AI DAO & Community Governance Layer

Ensures the network’s **decentralized nature** and long-term sustainability:

* Enables community co-governance via BNB Chain’s governance framework and DGAI tokens.
* Community members participate in key decisions: parameter adjustments, incentive rule design, and model approval processes.
* Gradually evolves into a community-driven ​**public AI infrastructure**​.

> Critical Note: BNB Chain is not just a deployment layer — it’s the core ​**trusted settlement and governance layer**​. Inference fee settlement, incentive distribution, reputation tracking, and governance voting all run on BNB Chain, ensuring openness, transparency, and tamper-resistance.

Through collaboration across the three tiers, DGrid tightly couples AI’s computing/intelligence layer with BNB Chain’s asset, governance, and trust layers. This achieves two core goals: **decentralizing AI capabilities** and ​**securing value flows**​.

## Core Designs & Features

Built on its three-tier architecture, DGrid’s four core designs directly solve industry pain points:

### 1. Unified API & Intelligent Routing: Lower Barriers, Boost Efficiency

DGrid offers a **one-stop access point** for developers, eliminating interface fragmentation:

* Developers integrate with the DGrid API once to access all LLMs, specialized models, and AI Agents in the network.
* No need to maintain multiple SDKs — drastically reducing development and operational costs.
* Intelligent routing dynamically matches requests to the optimal service combination based on: model capabilities (performance, specialization), node status (load, latency), and cost (per-inference pricing) — balancing performance and affordability.

### 2. Proof of Quality (PoQ): Verifiable, Auditable AI Inference

DGrid innovates with the Proof of Quality (PoQ) algorithm, building a **quality verification framework** for AI inference:

* Full recording and sampling verification of inference processes and results.
* Continuous evaluation of node/model historical performance to generate credibility scores.
* Key verification data is on-chained to BNB Chain, ensuring traceability and immutability.

This is critical for Web3 use cases: DeFi strategy optimization, risk control, sentiment analysis, and on-chain game logic can all rely on PoQ-verified AI outputs — significantly reducing **black-box decision-making** risks.

### 3. Free Market & Value Discovery: AI as Routable Liquidity

In the DGrid ecosystem, models, Agents, and Prompts are defined as ​**tradable intelligent resources**​, maximizing value via market mechanisms:

* Each resource includes clear pricing, performance metrics, and historical data for easy user comparison.
* Intelligent routing enables free resource flow, creating ​**routable, verifiable, and price-comparable intelligent liquidity**​.
* Creators connect directly with users, building their own reputation and user base — no longer dependent on centralized platforms for distribution.
* Healthy competition drives models/nodes to improve quality and reduce costs, letting users access high-quality AI at lower prices.

DGAI plays a central role in incentives and settlement: Users pay for services with DGAI; node operators, model authors, and Agent builders earn DGAI for their contributions; governance rights are tied to token holdings — creating a **virtuous cycle** where “more contributions = more rewards = greater governance power.”

### 4. Decentralized Computing & Elastic Scheduling: Resist Single Points of Failure & Censorship

DGrid uses a distributed node network to provide computing power, building a ​**decentralized AI cloud**​:

* Any node operator meeting hardware requirements can join, contributing GPU/CPU resources.
* The network dynamically schedules resources based on latency, cost, and credibility scores — enabling elastic scaling.
* Multi-node redundancy minimizes downtime risks; the distributed architecture is inherently censorship-resistant, aligning with Web3’s open, neutral ethos.

## DGrid AI & BNB Chain: Beyond Deployment — Ecosystem Synergy

DGrid chose BNB Chain as its foundation not just for deployment, but for its performance, cost-efficiency, and ecosystem advantages — achieving “1+1>2” synergy:

### 1. Deep Infrastructure Integration

* Leverages BNB Chain’s high TPS and low gas fees to handle large-scale inference settlement and incentive distribution.
* Reuses BNB Chain’s mature wallets, toolchains, and cross-chain solutions — lowering access barriers for developers and users.
